If you are a graduate student in NPRE 412, a large part of your grade is earned 
with a final project. It is intended to tie together the lessons of the course 
with an independent analysis of a relevant topic in the context of nuclear 
power economics and fuel management (or, the nuclear fuel cycle). 

Final projects will be assessed as independent research work, much like a 
journal article undergoes peer review. I will be looking for : 

\begin{itemize}
\item Relevance
\item Novelty
\item Technical Detail 
\item Analytic Rigor
\item Verifiability
\item Clarity
\item A Conclusion
\end{itemize}

This work will consist of two deliverables, a proposal and a final report. 


% ---------------------------------------------
\begin{questions}
\addpoints

% intro
\question[10] \textbf{Proposal: Due October 6, 2017}

To help determine of reasonable scope, the first step of the project will be a
proposal. Once you submit this proposal, I will respond with feedback. Much
like a conference abstract, the proposal should meet the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum 500 words.
\item Maximum 1000 words.
\item Two columns.
\item Reasonable margins.
\item 10 pt font or larger.
\item State the question you plan to answer.
\item Summarize the current state of the art in the literature.
\item Motivate the problem, explaining its relevance.
\item Describe the approach and methods you will take to answer the question.
\item Propose an outline of the analysis, software, data, and/or conclusions that will be delivered.
\end{itemize}

Please arrange at least one short meeting with me before the project proposal 
so that I can help you refine your topic. I would be happy to provide feedback 
on a draft of your proposal (once) before it is due. For your guidance, a list 
of example topics appears at the end of this document. Feel free to choose one 
of these.  However, choosing a creative topic of your choice is 
encouraged.


\question[90] \textbf{Final Report: Due December 13, 2017}

Prepare a final document in the style of a journal article or conference 
proceedings. It should meet the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum 3000 words.
\item Maximum 10000 words.
\item Two columns.
\item Reasonable margins.
\item 10 pt font or larger.
\item State the question you answered.
\item Comprehensively report and cite the current state of the art in the literature.
\item Motivate the problem, explaining its relevance.
\item Describe the approach, methods, and other elements of your solution.
\item Describe in detail: the analysis, software, data, conclusions produced in this work.
\item Include publication quality graphs and figures.
\item Cite and provide data and code generated for this work sufficient to reproduce the conclusions.
\item Compare this result to previous results in the literature, reinforce the relevance of the work. 
\item Suggest future work.
\end{itemize}

\end{questions}


\section{Topic Examples}
For your guidance, a list of example topics appears here.
Feel free to choose one of these.  However, choosing a creative topic 
of your choice is encouraged.  

\paragraph{Impact of a Zero Emissions Tax Credit} New York state recently 
(summer 2016) implemented a zero emissions tax credit. It was enough to save 
the Fitzpatrick nuclear generating station. Were the parameters of that 
state-level to be implemented accross the US, either federally or individually 
in each state, the risk of owning and building nuclear plants would decrease. 
Quantify the change in risk. Predict the impacts to the nuclear industry. Would 
it be enough to save at-risk plants? Would we likely see an increase in new 
builds? What other impacts might we see? How did this tax credit operate 
differently or similarly to the Clean Jobs Bill recently passed in Illinois?

\paragraph{Illinois Senate Bill 2814, the Future Energy Jobs Bill} 
The state of Illinois similarly passed Senate Bill 2814, the Future Energy Jobs 
Bill. It saved the Clinton nuclear power plant from imminent shutdown. How did 
that bill economically incentivize Exelon to keep plants open? 
How long will this incentive be sufficient to keep these plants open?  If this 
bill were passed nationwide, what would the economic impacts be?

\paragraph{The Likelihood and Implications of the Duck Curve} The California
Independent System Operators published the ``duck chart.'' This curve,
describing the predicted mid-day overgeneration of grid-bound electricity,
caused by installations of solar, primarily, makes load-following generation
sources or storage methods necessary. A few questions that would make
interesting projects on this topic include:  
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the level of alarm appropriate in reaction to this chart and why? 
\item Can you suggest a novel strategy that would allow nuclear generation to
be adapted to load follow? 
\item What would the impact to nuclear power be if this situation is allowed to
proceed and there is no curtailment of variable generation sources? 
\item How could current storage technologies smooth this curve?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Liquid vs. Solid Fuelled Molten Salt Reactor Source Term and Release
Pathways} Reactor designs involving molten salts can have either solid fuel or
fluidized fuel. In the fluid fuel case, proponents are often heard to say they
can't melt down because they operate safely at a melted state. Compare the
source term and release pathways of a containment breach in a solid fuelled
salt reactor vs. a fluid fuelled one. 

\paragraph{Economics of Uranium Extraction of Seawater} A great deal of
research is being undertaken to lower the costs of uranium extraction from
seawater. Can you replicate the results of a previous calculation of those
costs? To what extent are those results sensitive to uncertain assumptions
(assumptions of a political, technical, or economic nature, it matters not.)

\paragraph{Metrics for Proliferation in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle} Suggest a
metric that captures proliferation concern in a nuclear fuel cycle scenario.
Defend it. Analyze 

\paragraph{Assessment of Dose To Workers in Reprocessing Schemes} Propose a model for
calculating the dose impact on workers within an arbitrary fuel cycle. Include
dose due to all steps of the fuel cycle, including reprocessing and disposal.
Compare and contrast fuel cycle strategies with and without reprocessing. 

\paragraph{Fuel Cycle Transition Scenario} Choose one of the Evaluation Groups
identified by the Fuel Cycle Options Evaluation and Screening. Use a simulator
(e.g. Cyclus, CLASS, or Orion) or your own model to assess the
time-to-transition from our current reactor fleet to 100\% deployment of the
new technology (e.g. SFRs, MSRs, etc.)

\paragraph{Repository Cost Estimation} Suggest a high level waste repository
site. Suggest appropriate waste forms, waste packages, and other disposal
system design features for this geology. Estimate construction rates, loading
rates, transportation costs, and a closing timeline. With these estimates,
defended by analysis, conduct a life cycle cost estimation of your proposed
site.

\paragraph{Assessment of Competitiveness}
In the paper refernced below [1], the factors impacting competitiveness of fast 
reactors are assessed. Conduct a similar assessment for your favorite, 
different, reactor type (e.g. HTGR, MSR, FHR, etc).

reactors? Methodology and key parameters,” Progress in Nuclear Energy, vol. 
100, pp. 103–113, Sep. 2017.
